About
===========
Collaborative robots are a form of robotic automation built to work safely alongside human workers in a shared, collaborative workspace. In most applications, a collaborative robot is responsible for repetitive, menial tasks while a human worker completes more complex and thought-intensive tasks. The accuracy, uptime and repeatability of collaborative robots is designed to complement the intelligence and problem-solving skills of a human worker.

Collaborative robot designs differ greatly from their industrial robot counterparts. Featuring rounded edges, force limitations, and light weights, collaborative robots are first and foremost designed for safety. Most collaborative robots are equipped with a series of sensors to avoid collisions with human workers, as well as safety protocols to shut down if any form of unplanned contact occurs.

The ability to work collaboratively with humans greatly expands the potential applications of robotic automation. The market for collaborative robots is expected to experience exponential growth as more and more industries realize the profits to be gained from this technology.

With major market potential in a number of industries inside and outside of the factory setting, collaborative robots will be an exciting technology to keep an eye on as it becomes a prominent form of robotic automation.

With the above points in mind we set out to make a unique project that combines machine learning and AI with a moveable robotic platform such as a Turtlebot 4 running ROS2 Galactic to get it to follow commands. The commands are hand gestures given by the user remotely using a webcam attached to a laptop. A RandomForrestCLassifier has been trained on X and Y coordinates of the hand landmarks generated by the mediapipe python library to accurately predict the commands based on the hand gestures provided by the user. The predicted commands are published as Twist messages over the ROS network to the /cmd_vel topic in the Turtlebot 4.
